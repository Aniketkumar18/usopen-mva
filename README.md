The datasets selected for this project are based on Tennis major tournaments match statistics. The datasets contained separate excel files for both Men and Women Tennis players match statistics in US-Open 2013. Our motivation for selecting this dataset to perform the multivariate analysis is to study how men tennis player performances differ from women tennis players in a major tennis tournament and to study which attributes are correlated and significant to determine match win in men or women tennis match.
